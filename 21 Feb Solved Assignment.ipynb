    "Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python that is commonly used for building web applications and APIs. Flask is used in this web scraping project likely because it provides a simple and easy-to-use framework for building the web application or API that will expose the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Flask is often used in web scraping projects because it allows developers to quickly and easily build a web interface for the scraped data. This can be useful for visualizing and exploring the data, or for making it accessible to others through a web-based API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides a number of features that are useful for building web applications and APIs, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Routing: Flask makes it easy to define URLs and the corresponding functions that handle those URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Templating: Flask includes a templating engine that makes it easy to generate dynamic HTML pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Request handling: Flask provides a simple way to handle HTTP requests and parse data submitted through forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Response handling: Flask allows developers to easily return data in a variety of formats, including HTML, JSON, and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extensibility: Flask can be extended with a wide range of third-party libraries and plugins, making it highly customizable.\n",

    "1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): EC2 is a scalable compute service that provides virtual machines (instances) that can be used to run applications, including web scraping scripts. EC2 instances can be configured with specific CPU, memory, and storage requirements, and can be scaled up or down depending on the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 is an object storage service that can be used to store the data scraped from websites. S3 provides high durability and availability, and can be configured to automatically replicate data across multiple availability zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): SQS is a fully-managed message queuing service that can be used to decouple the web scraping process from the data processing pipeline. Web scraping scripts can push data to an SQS queue, which can then be processed by another application, such as an ETL pipeline or data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed database service that can be used to store the scraped data in a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. RDS provides high availability, automatic backups, and automated software patching.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service): ECS is a fully-managed container orchestration service that can be used to run web scraping scripts in Docker containers. ECS can be used to automatically manage the scaling, deployment, and availability of the containers.\n",
    "\n",
