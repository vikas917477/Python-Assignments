    "An exception in Python is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. It is an error that is raised when the code is executed and disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception is encountered, it generates an exception object, which contains information about the error and its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when the code written in the program violates the rules of the language's syntax. This means that the code is not in the proper format, and the Python interpreter cannot understand it. Syntax errors are detected before the code is executed, and they prevent the code from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection: Syntax errors are detected before the code is executed, while exceptions are raised during the execution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nature of error: Syntax errors are related to the improper use of the language's syntax, while exceptions are related to runtime errors such as division by zero, file not found, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error handling: Syntax errors can be corrected by fixing the code's syntax, while exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to continue its execution even after an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error message: Syntax errors result in error messages that are less descriptive and harder to understand, while exceptions result in error messages that contain more detailed information about the error and its cause."
