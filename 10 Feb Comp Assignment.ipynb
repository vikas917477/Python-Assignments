    "\n",
    "2.'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its content is truncated and overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing, but the writing is done at the end of the file, preserving the existing content of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is similar to the 'w' mode, but it raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.'b' (Binary): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or a audio file. You can open a binary file in either 'rb' (Read Only Binary) or 'wb' (Write Only Binary) mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.'+' (Read and Write): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. You can open a file in either 'r+' (Read and Write), 'w+' (Write and Read), or 'a+' (Append and Read) mode."
